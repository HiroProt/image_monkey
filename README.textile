ImageMonkey is a Rails 3 service that takes care of all your thumbnailing needs on the fly.

If ImageMonkey is setup to listen at *http://static.tanga.com*, to fetch original images from *http://www.tanga.com*, and a request comes in to *http://static.tanga.com/300/200!/images/logo.jpg*, ImageMonkey will:
 * Fetch http://www.tanga.com/images/logo.jpg (if it hasn't already)
 * Resize the image using ImageMagick to 300x200!
 * Smush the image using some tool like "http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it":http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it
 * Return the thumbnail to the client
 * Cache the thumbnail for future requests

If you use SSL on your main site, you'll probably want to setup ImageMonkey to use SSL as well.

That's pretty much it.  This system allows you to easily make changes to your thumbnail sizes, squashing algorithms, etc without modifying application code.

Random Thoughts:
 * If two requests come in at the same time for the same thumbnail that we haven't yet generated or fetched the original, we want to do the fetch/generation once, then serve the thumbnail to both clients. This should work across multiple machines.
 * Be able to support multiple machines -- some sort of file sharing probably needed?
 * Be efficient -- don't block.  
 * Possibly support URL signing to prevent hotlinking or unauthorized resizing
